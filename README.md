# A Complete Cycle of Credit Risk Modelling 
As a Data Science project, We aim to use data science techniques to model three important notions in Credit risk management :
Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD).

The data set used for this purpose, is a <b>portofolio</b> open-source data (on Kaggle)
