# A Complete Cycle of Credit Risk Modelling 
As a Data Science project, We aim to use data science techniques to model three important notions in Credit risk management :
Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD).

The data set used for this purpose, is a <b>portofolio of 466285 loans</b> open-source data (on Kaggle) and our purpose is to build models that are compliant with Basel II and Basel III regulations.

We at the end of this work, compute the <b>Expected Loss (EL)</b> and the <b>Regulatory Capital </b> (F- IRB) that will be expected by the regulations for this portfolio.

The work is subdivide as it follows :

>>>> <b> I - DATA PREPARATION </b>
           Import, Explore, Preprocess (formatting, dealing with missing values..)
      
     <b> II - PD Model </b>
